Having recently moved to Melbourne from the comfort of a long, reliable and rewarding hairdresser relationship in Perth, I was wary (to say the least) of entering into a new hair-relationship with too much haste and not enough research. So it was that I went to the knowledge banks of yelp.

Once again, the good people of yelp have unveiled a hidden wonder! Thank you good people.

After arriving at the correct shop number, I was a little confused as the appearance of the hairdresser seemed to me to be more like a restaurant. I asked the owners, and it turns out that, yes, there was a hairdresser at this address and that his work took place ABOVE the restaurant up the stairs into an area I would've guessed to be more suited to horigotatsu style seating than a hairdresser, but I guess that just shows what I know about trendy hairdressers.

Tom, as he is the only hairdresser, has one person in his room at a time. And somehow, from the moment you walk in the door, he fills you with a sense of not trustworthiness. He seems to understand all aspects of hair - its health, its future health, its volume, its colour - that make all previous hairdressers seem to be what a backyard barbeque "guru" is to a Michelin star chef. Everything he says makes sense, in a way only someone with a superior knowledge and best interests of your hair could say.  "I have a vision for your hair - I don't want to see you again until September" he told me in April. I don't think many hairdressers would say that unless they truly had a vision.

Since that time, my hair has grown out and I have received 4 completely unsolicited compliments on my hair from complete strangers. I would like to note that this has happened to me maybe once before in my life, so 4 in 3 months since Tom is more than just a coincidence.

Trustworthy service and expert advice. Couldn't recommend more.
