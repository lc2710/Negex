There is a whole kids corner filled with toys and games to get them out of your hair while you dig into something more grown up than runny eggs and soldiers, like a chorizo and haloumi burger, then reward them with one of the prettiest babyccinos you've ever seen. \n\nIf you want to go all out, Rell's healthy jar is as delicious as it is 'grammable. Messy, colourful and all-around satisfying, it is a mix of seasonal fruits, non-sweetnened natural yoghurt, organic honey, mixed berries and sprinkle of chia topped off with their special seed mix. It's a party in a mason jar, and we can't get enough.\n\nFor something to warm the soul, it's got to be the house-made porridge with fresh banana, brown sugar and warmed milk or honey. We love to order this one on a rainy day and watch the world go by while we smugly sit indoors.\n\nThere is always something delicious on the specials menu, but it changes every week so we won't spoil the fun too much. Past favourites include a lip-smacking pulled pork roll or lentil hot pot. \n\nWhether it's a long, lingering breakfast, a coffee catch up, or a quick lunch, Rell's Kitchen is the only place to be for breakfast in Randwick.",
