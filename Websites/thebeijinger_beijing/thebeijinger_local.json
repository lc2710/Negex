It contains some 70 courtyard homes, many of which have been converted into simple guesthouses, and villagers open their homes and hearts to city-slicker refugees. Nightly accommodation can be found in any home that has room enough and averages RMB 15-25.

The valley, babbling with brooks and pools of ever increasing clarity, sports the usual carved characters etched into the walls."}]
